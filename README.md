# UMKCFS2017_Hackathon

### Problem statement:

UMKC will need a tool that will manage the 1,500+ documents collected and used to support the university’s Higher Learning Commission Accreditation Reaffirmation process. Help us keep UMKC accredited!
* Like many institutions, UMKC is required to maintain levels of quality and excellence to remain accredited. 
* This is carried out via a review process, which requires gathering thousands of documents 
* Our team was tasked with creating an app to upload & store files, retrieve & filter files, and show statistics
